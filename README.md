I played around with my background colour until I was happy with it, just figuring out how the different amounts of colour worked with each other. 

### Triangle
A triangle has three sets of coordinates one for each corner:

I had trouble using different variables to move the triangle but made the two bottom points move until they touched the bottom of the canvas.

### Lines
I made two lines move at the same time across the canvas and reach the end and stop at the same time as the triangle.
